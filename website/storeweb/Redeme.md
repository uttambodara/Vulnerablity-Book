🎯 **Today's Focus: The door39.store Website** 🎯

I embarked on exploring the juc.edu.bd website, adhering to the guidelines set by my instructor for a vulnerability assessment task. My initial step was to conduct a WHOIS lookup to ascertain the website's origins.

**What is SQL Injection?**

SQL Injection is a code injection technique where an attacker executes malicious SQL queries that control a web application’s database. With the right set of queries, a user can gain access to information stored in databases. SQLMAP tests whether a ‘GET’ parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection. 

**Where can you use SQLMAP?**

If you observe a web url that is of the form http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1, where the ‘GET’ parameter is in bold, then the website may be vulnerable to this mode of SQL injection, and an attacker may be able to gain access to information in the database. Furthermore, SQLMAP works when it is php based.
